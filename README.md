Gunbound
=========
Simple implementation of my favorite childhood game using PubNub and HTML5 Canvas.


1. Open two browser windows of index.html
2. Wait for opponent to load
3. Press spacebar to shoot
4. Refresh both pages to restart

*There can only be two index.html windows open at a time*

*Get your own PubNub API Key*
